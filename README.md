# Pokemon Pokedex
In this project we built a JavaScript project using the PokeApi and the Involvement Api. This project displays
a Pokedex of about 50 rare pokemons. Details of specific pokemon are also displayed in a modal window where comments 
can be added. Users are also allowed to give likes to their favorite pokemon.

 ## Learning objectives
- Use JavaScript modules
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
